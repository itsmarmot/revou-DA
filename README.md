# Vehicle Sales Data Analytics Case Study
Welcome! This repository houses a comprehensive data analysis project based on the [RevoU data analytics mini-course](https://revou.co/mini-course-data-analytics). In this case study, I delve into the dynamic world of vehicle sales, aiming to extract insights and answers from a dataset containing valuable information about various vehicles.

### **Case Study Overview:**
In this project, I tackle several intriguing questions related to vehicle sales using a dataset provided in both raw and cleaned formats. The key questions we seek to answer include:
1. Which product lines have the highest and lowest sales? Create a chart that is representable?
2. Show sales performance over time, is there any pattern?
3. How does deal size (small, medium, large) correlate with total sales? and What is the percentage of contribution for each type of deal?
(ðŸ’¡ Optional: Create with PandasAI)
